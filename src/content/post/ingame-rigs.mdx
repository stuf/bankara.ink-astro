# How to

## How to smiling/frowning face

<div class="float-right pl-6">
  ![Item Properties](./ingame-rigs/item-properties.png)
</div>

In 3D view:

1. If you are not in <mark>Object mode</mark>, switch to <mark>Object mode</mark>

1. Select the rig/armature

1. Open the "N-panel"/right side panel if it's not already open (`n` on the keyboard)

1. Go to the <mark>Item</mark> tab

1. Under <mark>Properties</mark> there is a property named `face_model`; set it to `1` for the default neutral face, `2` for smiling, `3` for frowning

  <summary>Tech info</summary>

The three different face models are their own separate objects, found in the rig's `face` collection. Changing faces has been implemented through Blender's <mark>Drivers</mark>,
which shows/hides the appropriate face models.
