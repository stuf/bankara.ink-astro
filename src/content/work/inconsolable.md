# Inconsolable

She would normally bite her lip and hold her tongue and brush off the question of her past, dismissing it nonchalantly.

- Normally Cappy would brush off the topic of her past
- It would be too much to tell someone
- Pippy makes her feel safe for the first time
- Cappy breaks down into crying hysterically, kicking and screaming
- She starts the process of letting go of her pain
