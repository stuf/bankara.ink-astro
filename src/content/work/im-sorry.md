# "I'm sorry"

> ...for being so useless. I'm sorry. I'm wake up in the morning, thinking I'm the luckiest girl in the world until I realize how much better it would be if I didn't exist. How much better off everybody would be. How I wouldn't be a burden. How much better it would be for everyone...

Cappy has her arms tightly wrapped around his body from behind. She speaks in an uneven tone, in between loudly sobbing, letting out shrieks in her anguish.

She hasn't really been this way ever since that time with Pippy on the rooftop and things had felt pretty good for her since. She thought maybe she could have it easier, maybe it would be easier for her to carry on now that she knew she had someone she trusted around her. And yet she was in pain she hadn't felt before.

It had been previously just her. But now she wasn't alone. She'd surely drive anyone off witnessing her, she thought.
