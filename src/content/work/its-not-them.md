# It's not them. It's you.

Cappy would often return to that one train station she remembers from years ago. It used to be a place where she felt a strange sensation of belonging, somehow, somewhere, with someone. But time passes, moods shift and people change. That place she would always return to would start to grow cold and she would start feeling like it wasn't as much as the place comforting her but that she was still returning, longing for something that wasn't there any longer. In the end, she was stuck as if chained, unable to leave even if she wanted to.

It wasn't that the world went on leaving her in place. It was her, being stuck in a place she tried to hold on for far too long, not remembering to catch the train.
