# Stargazing

Once she opens up, he's greeted by just a girl who has waited all her life for someone who she could be herself withâ€”and felt not just allowed to, but encouraged to be her cheery, whimsical self.

> Do you ever look up at the stars and just feel... lost? Like there are so many of them and it makes you think...
>
> I used to look up when I was small, it would become my home. When the world felt awful, I would lie in my bed, looking out of the window into those same stars, and imagine myself up there...
>
> Now it feels like that home I had up there has come down from there to me. With you, it feels like home.
