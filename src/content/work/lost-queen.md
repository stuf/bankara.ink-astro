# Lost Queen

Even though she had a cheerful demeanor, inside Cappy felt incredibly lonely. The wide childlike smile would hide beneath it a kind of pain that she could never really put into words, but it would feel like there was a void, something that felt like it was eating her from the inside out.

She was no stranger to train stations&mdash;after all it was the primary way that she would get around&mdash;she would find herself strangely pulled to throw herself onto the tracks. Would she feel at ease? Could she?

Would she be missed if she did that?
