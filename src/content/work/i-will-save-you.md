# "I will save you"

Pippy's arms wrap around Cappy in a motherly embrace, where all of Cappy's doubts and fears disappear and time itself feels like it's stopped.

Cappy had felt lost for most of her life. There was an indescribable weight to every waking moment she would experience&mdash;a weight that felt like everything was tinted in this dull, lifeless-seeming hue&mdash;without it bubbling into her consciousness.

That she accidentally bumped into Pippy on that day, she hasn't come to realize how tightly their paths would wound up in the end.
