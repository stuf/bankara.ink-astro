# "What was your childhood like?"

They had spent hours on the rooftop talking about almost anything and everything under the sun. Almost anything, because at least for Cappy, she would avoid mentioning her past.

> Say, Cappy, when you were a child... what was it like?

Silence. Cappy would blank-out for a while; it wasn't that she had feared having to have this asked of her, especially from Pippy. In fact, part of her wanted to have this asked of her, because she could not bring this up herself.

Thinking about it is one thing, actually the thing she secretly hoped that would happen, happening is another and it would take a moment for her to gather her thoughts.

It was different this time. She _wanted_ to tell Pippy all about what she had been through. For the first time in her life she felt like she could and already would feel the walls crumbling, the walls she had built for her to keep her memories tucked away, out of her mind.
