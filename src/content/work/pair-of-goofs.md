# A pair of goofs

Whereever they went together, laughter would follow. Even though their upbringing was so radically different from each other there was a kind of gravity that would pull the two together, creating a kind of cheerful presence that was impossible to not get pulled into. Or maybe it was the fact that each of their experience of life had been what it was that made them work so well together.

Both were curious creatures who would end up on adventures regardless where they went and even the most seemingly mundane-feeling place would open up its own little universe full of wonder to them to spend their time in.
