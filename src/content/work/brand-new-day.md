# Sleeping beauty

Cappy easily wakes up from her sleep. Especially when something unusual is going on, her sleep ends up being light just out of caution. However, she would begin to learn that these unusual things wouldn't necessarily always mean something that she should be afraid of.

For the first time in her life she wakes now wakes up closely nestled against something, or more specifically _someone_. She peeks through her still sleepy eyelids still half-asleep, weighing whether or not to go back to sleep. It's really early, after all. Time to snooze a little bit, this time. Except she suddenly jolts awake in an instant.

> W-w-wait what happened last night? And who is t--

Cappy doesn't even manage to finish the sentence in her head when her consciousness crashes back awake and she realizes she's looking at someone's nape. The sudden reaction of panic she has however, suddenly shifts into something that she doesn't feel frightened by. In fact, for a change, she's overswept by something that feels really... nice.

Letting herself feel comfortable for once, she pokes him to make sure it's real, wrapping her hand around him and soaking in the moment.
